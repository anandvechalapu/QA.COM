    <h1>Lambda Functionality for SACRAL AI Application</h1>
    <p>
      As a developer, I want to incorporate the AWS cloud into the sacral AI application by implementing Lambda functionality, so that I can leverage the benefits of serverless computing and improve the scalability, availability, and reliability of my application's backend.
    </p>
    <p>
      To achieve this goal, we will use Lightning Web Components (LWC) to create a custom component that encapsulates the Lambda functionality. This component will allow developers to easily incorporate Lambda functionality into their applications with minimal effort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The component will consist of a simple form where the user can enter their AWS credentials and the code for their Lambda function. Once entered, the component will take care of the rest, from setting up the Lambda function to invoking it when needed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The component will also provide a simple interface for monitoring the status of the Lambda function, as well as any errors or warnings that may arise.
